This is based on [lecture notes](https://github.com/adrianN/Optimisation-SS10-UdS/) I took together with Sebastian Steenbruck in 2010.

In this series of posts I'll talk about Approximation Algorithms and Linear Programming and how the two relate to each other. You will need some linear algebra to understand everything.
