Consider the following game between the head of the university, Carole, and the head of the CS department, Paul. There are six ranks in the academic hierarchy: Undergrad, Graduate, PhD, Postdoc, Senior Researcher, and Tenured Professor. Let \\(S\\) be the set of students and suppose that there are \\(a_i\\) students at rank \\(i\\). 

Every semester Paul selects a subset \\(H\\) of the students and recommends them for advancing their level. Carol either accepts Paul's recommendation, upon which \\(H\\) advances and \\(S-H\\) gets kicked out, or the other way round. Paul wants to get as many of his students to tenure as possible, while Carole tries to save money by kicking out as many students as possible.

What are the conditions on the \\(a_i\\) that allow Paul to force at least one student to reach tenure?
