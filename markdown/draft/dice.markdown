Suppose I challenge to a game of chance. Each of us rolls a die and the higher die wins. I present to you a set of three dice,

and let you choose your die first. Which one would you choose? The leftmost, while the middle. Maybe the last? It turns out, whatever die you choose, I can choose one that beats yours statistically.

Don't believe me? Let's do the calculation

So we see that I win with a probability of 55.55%. In this post we will try to find sets of dice with larger probabilities of beating your opponent.
