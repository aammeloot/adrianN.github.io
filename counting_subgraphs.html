<p>Suppose you have a very large graph, for example a protein-protein interaction graph for some complicated synthesis pathway. To draw conclusions from such a wealth of data, it is typically helpful to look for certain patterns, or subgraphs.</p>
<p>Finding, or indeed even counting, small sized subgraphs in a large graph seems to be a very hard problem: The number of candidate positions against which you need to match your subgraph explodes com­bi­na­to­ri­cal­ly. The situation is even more hopeless if the data doesn’t fit into main memory anymore.</p>
<p>To address the problem of working with graphs that don’t fit into RAM the streaming model was introduced. Here the algorithm has a very limited amount of storage, say O(<span class="LaTeX">$\log n$</span>) bits, and the in­put is pre­sent­ed as a stream of edges. The algorithm is only allowed to make a small number of passes over the data.</p>
<p>Only few problems can be solved exactly in this model, but often it is possible to find good approximation algorithms. In this post we will have a look at how to count triangles in the streaming model. Very similar techniques can be used to count arbitrary constant size subgraphs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Triangle counting already is a relevant problem in itself. It has applications for example in community detection in graphs. There the clustering coefficient, i.e. how many of a node’s neighbours are adjacent to each other (and thus form triangles), plays a central role. Indeed there are several papers <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on counting triangles using MapReduce as a way to tackle the large networks we face today. The streaming algorithm I’ll present here is a simple alternative to this.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>
<p>This algorithm is from a paper by Jowhari and Ghodsi <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It is extremely simple. We need a source of sufficiently independent random bits, say an explicit polynomial generator of degree 12. That is a polynomial <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> over some sufficiently large field with random coefficients. The random numbers are then <span class="LaTeX">$p(1),p(2),\ldots$</span> and we use their binary representation for a stream of random numbers <span class="LaTeX">$b[1],\ldots, b[n]$</span>, with <span class="LaTeX">$b[i] \in \{-1,1\}$</span>. Note that we can encode this generator using only a logarithmic number of bits for the coefficients.</p>
<p>As we see the edges <span class="LaTeX">$(u,v),(x,y),\ldots$</span> we sum up <span class="LaTeX">$b[u]b[v]$</span>, that is the algorithm computes</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Z = \sum_{(u,v)\in E} b[u]b[v]$$</span></p>
<p>The output is then</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{1}{6} Z^3.$$</span></p>
<p>That’s it. Algorithm over. This might seem too simple to be correct, but it actually works. Observe that we output</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac 16 \sum_{(u,v), (w,x), (y,z) \in E} b[u]b[v]b[w]b[x]b[y]b[z]$$</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="LaTeX">$b[u]^k$</span> is zero in expectation for odd <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span>, only terms with even powers count (in expectation) in this sum.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Hence only if <span class="LaTeX">$u=z$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$v=w$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$x=y$</span> we count this term. This is exactly true if the three edges form a triangle! Of course we over count, since there are <span class="LaTeX">$3*2*1=6$</span> permutations of the three edges and they all occur in the sum, but we simply divide by six and get the right thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is only true in expectation, the actual value can differ quite a bit. But it is not too difficult to bound the variance of <span class="LaTeX">$Z$</span> and hence get a good estimate of how often we need to run this with fresh random variables to get a good estimate. Have a look at the paper to get the actual numbers. In the streaming model we can simply run these instances in parallel.</p>
<p>In did a few experiments and it seems like the high independence that we require in the analysis is actually not so important for random graphs. My results indicate that a normal linear congruential generator already provides sufficient randomness to get good estimates, so the algorithm is really trivial to implement.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>If you ask yourself why we can take the expectation of the individual <span class="LaTeX">$b[u]$</span>, even though they appear in a product, this is because they are sufficiently independent. For the expectation calculation six-way independent random numbers would be sufficient (there are six terms in the product), but for the variance calculation that I don’t show here we need <span class="LaTeX">$E(Z)^2$</span>, hence 12-way independence.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
